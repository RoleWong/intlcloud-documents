## Overview
This document describes how to create a container-based EMR cluster in the EMR console.
## Prerequisites
1. You have completed the role authorization. For more information, see [Role Authorization](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1026/34539).
2. You have completed the COS authorization. When you create a cluster, if COS access has not been granted, the following prompt will be displayed. Click **Authorize now** to authorize COS. After successful COS authorization, you won't need to authorize COS again when creating clusters in the future.

2. On the **Create Cluster** page, configure the following items:
	
| Field Name  | Description                         |
|---------|---------|
| Cluster Name 	| 1. The name can contain 6â€“36 letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores. <br/>2. A random cluster name will be generated by default. | 
| Region 	| A region is the physical location of an IDC. Currently supported regions include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing. | 
| Cluster Type 	| Currently, Spark and RSS cluster types are supported. | 
| Component Version 	| Components and their version information under the selected cluster type. | 
| Container Type | If you want to select an EKS cluster but there is none in your region, a hidden EKS cluster (counted against the quota) will be automatically created to expand EMR compute resources. | 
| Container Network 	| Set a network dedicated for the hidden EKS cluster. If you have selected a container network for this EKS cluster, it is bound and cannot be changed. | 
| Specification Configuration	| Currently, resource specifications can be configured only for RSS clusters. You can configure the Pod specification of the `Coordinator` and `Shuffle Server` roles as needed. Note that once specified, the data disk type, disk size and quantity, CPU type and range, and memory range cannot be modified. | 
| COS Bucket | 1. Select an existing bucket or create a new one in the COS console. <br/>2. Before using COS, you need to grant COS read/write permissions to the EMR cluster first. | 

3. Click **Create**. Then, you can view the newly created cluster in the EMR console.
