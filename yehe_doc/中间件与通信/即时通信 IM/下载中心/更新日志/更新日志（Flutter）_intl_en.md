|---------|---------|---------|
| iOS | Supported by all versions | Supported by all versions |
| Android | Supported by all versions | Supported by all versions |
| [Web](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/45907) | Supported from v4.1.1+2 | Supported from v0.1.5 |
| [macOS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/45907) | Supported from v4.1.8 | Will be supported soon |
