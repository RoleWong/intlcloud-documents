## Overview

This webhook event is used by the app backend to check users' group creation requests in real time. The app backend can also reject the requests.

## Notes

- To enable this webhook, you must configure a webhook URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook event, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Webhook Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Webhook Triggering Scenarios

- The app user creates a group on the client.
- The app admin creates a group through the RESTful API.

## Webhook Triggering Timing

It will be triggered before the Chat backend creates a group.

}
```

#### Creation disallowed

The user is not allowed to create a group. No group will be created, and the error code `10016` will be returned to the caller.

{
    "ActionStatus": "OK",
    "ErrorInfo": "",

| ErrorCode | Integer | Yes | Error code returned. `0`: Allows group creation; `1`: Forbids group creation. If the business side wants to use a custom error code to forbid a user to create a group and send `ErrorCode` and `ErrorInfo` to the client, ensure that the value of `ErrorCode` is set within the range of [10100, 10200]. |
| ErrorInfo | String | Yes | Error information |
