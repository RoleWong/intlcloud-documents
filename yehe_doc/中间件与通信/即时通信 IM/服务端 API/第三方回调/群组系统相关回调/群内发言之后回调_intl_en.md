## Feature Overview

This webhook event is used by the app backend to check users' group messages in real time. The app backend can be notified when a group message is sent successfully and can synchronize the data as required.

## Limits

- To enable this webhook, you must configure a callback URL and enable the corresponding switch for this webhook. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook event, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Webhook Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Webhook Triggering Scenarios

- An app user sends a group message on the client.
- The app admin sends a group message via RESTful APIs.

## Webhook Triggering Timing

The webhook is triggered after a group message is sent successfully.
