## Overview

This webhook event is used by the app backend to check the recalls of group messages in real time.

## Notes

- To enable this webhook, you must configure a webhook URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Webhook Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this webhook event, the Chat backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the webhook request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Webhook Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Webhook Triggering Scenarios
