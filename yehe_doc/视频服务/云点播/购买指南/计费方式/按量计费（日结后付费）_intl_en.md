### Billing details

- Prices vary with storage region and storage class. If you change the storage class of a media file, the price for the new storage class will apply.
- Rules: Storage fees are charged based on the storage class and peak storage space used per day. **Storage fees for regions inside and outside the Chinese mainland are charged separately**.
- Billing formula: Daily storage fee = Peak storage space used in the Chinese mainland (GB) x Unit price (USD/GB/day) + Peak storage space used outside the Chinese mainland (GB) x Unit price (USD/GB/day).

### Billing example

Assume that on January 1, you stored media files in STANDARD in the Chinese mainland and the peak storage usage was 100 GB. You also stored media files in STANDARD_IA in Mumbai and the peak storage usage was 50 GB. On January 2, the storage fee billed for January 1 would be as follows:
100 (GB) x 0.0006 (USD/GB) + 50 (GB) x 0.0006 (USD/GB) = 0.06 (USD) + 0.03 (USD) = 0.09 (USD)

> !
>- You can delete files in the console to avoid incurring storage fees.
>- Minimum storage duration for STANDARD_IA files: 30 days. Storage fees for 30 days will be charged even if a file is stored for shorter than the period.
>- Minimum storage duration for ARCHIVE files: 90 days. Storage fees for 90 days will be charged even if a file is stored for shorter than the period.
>- Minimum storage duration for DEEP ARCHIVE files: 180 days. Storage fees for 180 days will be charged even if a file is stored for shorter than the period.

>? The transcoding type number corresponds to the component usage and unit fields of the sub-product "on-demand transcoding" in the billing bill. According to the transcoding type number, you can view the billed encoding method and resolution.

#### Billing details

- Rules: General transcoding fees are charged based on the duration and specification of the video file generated. Video specification is determined by the codec used and short side (px) of the video generated. Remuxing and audio transcoding are charged based on the output video duration.
- Billing formula: Video transcoding fee = Output video duration (min) x Unit price as per codec and resolution (USD/min)

#### Billing example
Assume that you transcoded a video file of 100 minutes into 2560 x 1440 and 1280 x 640 respectively using the H.264 codec on January 1, as well as an audio file of 100 minutes. On January 2, the transcoding fee billed for January 1 would be as follows:
0.0242 (USD/min) x 100 (min) + 0.0061 (USD/min) x 100 (min) + 0.002 (USD/min) x 100 (min) = 3.23 (USD)

>? The 2560 x 1440 video falls under the category of 2K (short side ≤ 1440 px), so the unit price is 0.0242 USD/min; the 1280 x 640 video falls under the category of HD (480 px ≤ short side ≤ 720 px), so the unit price is 0.0061 USD/min; the unit price for audio transcoding is 0.002 USD/min. The fee charged is the costs of the three tasks combined.

#### Billing details

**The billing rules are the same as those for general transcoding**. Output videos of different resolutions are charged separately.
#### Billing example

Assume that on January 1, you used VOD’s adaptive bitrate streaming service to transcode a video of 100 minutes into three resolutions: FHD (1920 x 1080), HD (1280 x 720), and SD (640 x 480). On January 2, the fee billed for January 1 would be as follows:
0.0121 (USD/min) x 100 (min) + 0.0061 (USD/min) x 100 (min) + 0.003 (USD/min) x 100 (min) = 2.21 (USD)

>? Because the video is transcoded into three specifications, each specification is charged and the fee is the sum of the three.



### Video editing

#### Pricing
- Video editing is billed according to the codec, duration, and resolution of the output file.
- The resolution-specific unit prices for video editing are the same as those for [general transcoding](#p2).

#### Billing details
- Rules: Charges are based on the resolution and duration of the output file. **Each video editing task is billed once according to the specification**.
- Billing formula: Video editing fee = Output file duration (min) x Unit price (USD/min) as per resolution and codec

#### Billing example
Assume that on January 1, you used the VOD editing feature to splice video A (10 min, 640 x 480) and video B (15 min, 1280 x 720) into video C (25 min, 1280 x 720). On January 2, the fee billed for January 1 would be as follows:
0.0061 (USD/min) x 25 (min) = 0.1525 (USD)
>? The codec used in the above examples is H.264. For more information about video editing, see [ComposeMedia](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34127) and [EditMedia](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34126).

#### Billing details

- Billable item: Digital watermarking and digital watermark extraction
- Rules: If you enable digital watermarking for a video, a digital watermark will be added to the video during transcoding, which will incur digital watermarking fees, transcoding fees, and storage fees. In case of unauthorized distribution, you can extract the user ID of the distributor from the video, which will incur digital watermark extraction fees.

#### Billing example

Assume that you enabled digital watermarking for a 60-minute 1080p video and transcoded the video using the H.264 codec to HLS. The digital watermarking fee incurred would be 0.062 x (60 x 2) =7.44 USD. The transcoding fee would be 0.0121 x (60 x 2)= 1.452 USD. The storage fee would be the size of the output file multiplied by the storage unit price.
If you extract the distributor’s user ID from the video in case of unauthorized distribution, the digital watermark extraction fee incurred would be 0.12 x 60 = 7.2 USD.

>?
>- No fees will be charged if digital watermark extraction fails.
>- When you add a digital watermark to a video, the video will be transcoded, which will incur transcoding fees. For details, see [Media Processing](#media-processing).
>- Saving transcoded files incurs storage fees. For details, see [Storage](#storage).

### DRM encryption

VOD uses established DRM solutions to encrypt videos during transcoding. If you enable DRM encryption, the encryption cost will be included in your transcoding fee. If you play DRM-encrypted videos to viewers, DRM playback fees will be charged based on the number of license requests.

#### Pricing

| Billable Item                        | Billed By     | Price          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------ |
| DRM license | The number of license requests (only pay-as-you-go supported) | 0.0012 USD/request |

#### Billing details

- Billable item: The number of license requests to play DRM-encrypted videos
- Rules: Transcoding fees are incurred for encrypting videos with DRM solutions, and DRM playback fees are charged based on the number of license requests.
- DRM fees = DRM encryption (transcoding) fees + DRM playback fees (based on the number of license requests)

#### Billing example

Assume that on January 1, you transcoded a video (length: 10 minutes; resolution: 2560 x 1440) using the H.264 codec and used VOD’s DRM encryption feature to encrypt it. The video generated was 10 minutes long and had a resolution of 1280 x 720, and there were 50 license requests to play it. On January 2, the DRM playback fee billed for January 1 would be as follows:

- The unit price of DRM playback is 0.0012 USD/request.

DRM playback fee on January 1 = 50 (requests) x 0.0012 (USD/request) = 0.06 USD

>?
>- DRM transcoding is billed in the same way as general transcoding. DRM transcoding fees are incurred each time you encrypt a video.
>- Encrypted videos take up storage space, which incurs storage fees. For details, see [Storage](#storage).

## Others

If you have a large-scale business (storage usage over 1 PB or daily traffic consumption over 10 TB), daily billing may not meet your needs. You can [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-us) for other billing options.
