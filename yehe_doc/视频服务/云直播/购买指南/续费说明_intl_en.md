## Daily Pay-As-You-Go

Your traffic/bandwidth, standard transcoding, and Top Speed Codec (TSC) transcoding usage with CSS is billed in the pay-as-you-go mode by default. If you are billed monthly, your bills will be generated on the first day of each month. You can view your billing details in **Message Center** > [Internal Message](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message/index/all/106?from=detail).
You can also [buy packages](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/resources/package?type=traffic) to avoid service suspension caused by overdue payments.

CSS offers a self-service purchase page for you to renew your packages.
