Time shifting is powered by the recording capability of CSS. It allows users to rewind and play earlier parts of a live stream. This is commonly used to play back highlights of live streamed sports events.


## Notes

- Time shifting is billed based on the traffic of live streams for which time shifting is enabled. Using this feature will also incur [playback traffic/bandwidth costs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2819).
- Time shifting is disabled by default. You can enable it in the console or using a TencentCloud API.

### Billing examples

Suppose a user created a time shifting template in the CSS console, bound it to a push domain, and started a live stream at 12:00, January 5. The live stream lasted for **five** hours. The video bitrate was 1 Mbps. The maximum number of time-shiftable days is seven days. 

Live streaming traffic = 1 Mbps x 18000 seconds รท 8 = 2.25 GB
Time shifting fee incurred on January 5 = 2.25 GB x 0.069 USD/GB = 0.15525 USD. The fee would be deducted on January 6.

Time shifting of the live stream is allowed from 12:00 on January 5 to 17:00 on January 12.
