You can disassociate a function from an event source by deleting a trigger in the console. After disassociation, the event source will no longer trigger the function.

## Deleting a Trigger in the Console
1. Log in to the SCF console and select **[Functions](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list)** on the left sidebar.
2. At the top of the **Functions** page, select the region and namespace where the function resides as shown below:

3. Click the function name to enter the function details page.
4. Select **Trigger management** on the left to enter the trigger browsing and operation page. Click **Delete** in the top-right corner of the target trigger as shown below:
