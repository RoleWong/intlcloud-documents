<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
If your function was created before January 29, 2021 and has not been migrated, but you want to use more log analysis features, deliver function invocation logs to CLS as instructed in [Log Delivery Configuration (Legacy)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/34876).
</dx-alert>



SCF was fully connected to [Tencent Cloud CLS](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/614) starting from January 29, 2021. After then, the invocation logs of newly created functions will be delivered to CLS, and logs can be output in real time. The existing functions are gradually migrated by regions. For more information, see [SCF Log Service Change Notification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/39328).

This document describes the two log delivery methods of [default delivery](#MRTD) and [custom delivery](#ZDYTD) provided by SCF and how to configure them.

## Permission Description

To view the logs normally, ensure that the sub-account at least has the read-only permission of CLS `QcloudCLSReadOnlyAccess`. For how the root account grant permissions for the sub-account, see [Authorization Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602).


## Restrictions

Delivering function invocation logs to CLS has the following limits:
- The maximum amount of logs printed within 5 seconds for each request is 1 MB.
- The maximum number of logs printed within 5 seconds for each request is 5000.
- The maximum length of each log is 8 KB, and excessive parts will be discarded.

For other limits, see [CLS Specification Description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/37887). Pay attention to whether the CLS configuration can meet your business needs. Exceeding the limits may cause log write failures.

## Directions
### Default delivery[](id:MRTD)

When creating a function, if you don't specify the destination topic for log delivery, the default log delivery capability will be used. For default log delivery, SCF will activate the CLS service for you and deliver the function invocation logs to the log topic under the SCF-specific logset. The SCF-specific logset and log topic are prefixed with `SCF_logset` and `SCF_logtopic` respectively, and will be created automatically if they do not exist. Function invocation logs will be retained for 7 days by default, and you can view and manage them on the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/logset).

>?
>- CLS is billed separately, and the SCF-specific log topic will consume the free tier of CLS. For more information, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/37509).
>- To ensure the proper display of logs in the SCF console, SCF-specific log topics do not support modifying the log index configuration. To customize the index configuration, configure the function log topic as instructed in **Custom delivery** below.

#### Configuring CLS

1. Log in to the SCF console and select **[Functions](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list)** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the region and namespace where to create a function at the top of the page and click **Create** to enter the function creation process.
3. In **Log configuration**, select **Default** as shown below: 
![](https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/u495555_%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_20221219162510.png)
5. Click **Complete**. You can view the log configuration in **Function management** > **Function configuration** as shown below: 
![](https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/QJkm326_%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_20221219162650.png)

#### Viewing and managing logs

You can click the logset ID in **Log Configuration** in **Function Configuration** to enter the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/logset) to view and manage logs. The SCF-specific logset is marked with the word `SCF` in the CLS console. If you need to persistently store, deliver, or consume logs or monitor and set alarms on log content, you can complete the configuration in the CLS console.




### Custom delivery[](id:ZDYTD)

When creating a function, if you need to specify the destination log topic to deliver function invocation logs, you can use the custom log delivery capability. Before using this capability, you should make sure that the [CLS](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/cls) service has been activated.


#### Creating logset and log topic

Log in to the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls) and [create a log topic](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/31592). This document uses the creation of the `SCF-test` log topic in Guangzhou as an example as shown below:
![](https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/nnQd736_%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_20221219162916.png)

>!For the logset region, select the region where the SCF service is located. Cross-region log push is not supported currently.
>


#### Configuring CLS

1. Log in to the SCF console and select **[Functions](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list)** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the region where to create a function at the top of the page and click **Create** to enter the function creation process.
3. In **Log configuration**, select **Custom** and select the log topic already created for this function. This document uses `SCF-test` as an example as shown below: 
![](https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/Jydh413_%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_20221219163220.png)
4. Click **Confirm**.


### Configuring indexes

Log search depends on the index configuration of the log topic. SCF will automatically complete the index configuration when you create a function. If the index is abnormal and logs cannot be viewed properly, configure the index in the following steps:

1. Log in to the SCF console and select **[Functions](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list)** on the left sidebar.
2. On the **Function Service** list page, select the name of the function whose index is abnormal to enter the **Function Management** page.
3. On the **Log Query** tab, select **Index Configuration** in **Advanced Retrieval** as shown below: 
![](https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/t6yP097_%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_20221219163510.png)
4. On the **Index configuration** page, enable **Index status** and **Key-value index** as shown below: 
![](https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/WgGb225_%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_20221219163648.png)
 This configuration method is only valid for scenarios where there are function invocation logs in the log topic; otherwise, manually configure the **key-value index** by referring to the table below.

<th>Field Type</th>

To ensure the display effect of the logs in the SCF console, toggle on **Enable Statistics** for the field in the key-value index configuration:
5. After configuring the index, click **OK**.
