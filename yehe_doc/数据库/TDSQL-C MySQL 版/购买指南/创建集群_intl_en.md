This document describes how to create a cluster in the TDSQL-C for MySQL console.

## Prerequisites
To make a purchase, you need to complete identity verification first. For more information, see [Identity Verification Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/cynosdb?regionId=8), complete the **Database Configuration** settings, and click **Next**.
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Compute Billing Mode</td>
<td>Monthly subscription, pay-as-you-go, and serverless billing modes are supported.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Region</td>
<td>Select a region for database deployment.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Source AZ</td>
<td>Select an AZ for deployment. Specific AZs in the selected region are shown on the actual purchase page.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Multi-AZ Deployment</td>
<td>Select whether to enable multi-AZ deployment. If you enable it, the replica AZ option will appear.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Replica AZ</td>
<td>It is disabled by default and can be selected after multi-AZ deployment is enabled.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Network</td>
<td><ul><li>For performance and security considerations, only VPC network is supported currently. CVM instances can communicate with TDSQL-C instances only in the same <a href="https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/215">VPC</a> in the same region.<br><li>A subnet is a logical network space in a VPC. You can create subnets in different AZs in the same VPC, which communicate with each other over the private network by default. Even if you select a subnet in another AZ in the same region, the network latency will not be increased because the actual business connection adopts nearby access.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Compatible Database</td>
<td>MySQL 5.7 and 8.0 are supported.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Compute Instance Quantity</td>
<td>A cluster can contain one read-write instance and one or more read-only instances. We recommend at least two instances to ensure high availability of the cluster. After the cluster is created, you can improve its read capability by adding more read-only instances.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Instance specification</td>
<td>For more information on calculating the instance specification and storage capacity, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1098/48406">Product Pricing</a>.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Storage Billing Mode</td>
<td><ul><li>Pay-as-you-go billing is supported, which means you only pay for the storage you use per hour and don't need to purchase any storage space here.<br></li><li>Monthly subscription billing is supported, which means you need to purchase monthly subscribed storage space now (billed in the entirety regardless of whether it is used up).</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Auto-renewal</td>
<td>Auto-renew the device monthly upon expiration if my account has sufficient balance</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

>- If your desired instance specification is sold out, you can click **Do you need it?**, and the pop-up window will display instances of the same specification in other AZs. If none of them meet your requirements, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.

>- Cluster quantity
>Pay-as-you-go: You can purchase up to ten TDSQL-C for MySQL clusters in each AZ. If you need more, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.
>Monthly subscription: You can purchase an unlimited number of clusters.
>- When the amount of data stored in a cluster exceeds its maximum storage space, the cluster can only read but not write data. In this case, you can choose to delete redundant data or upgrade the specification.
>
3. After the purchase is completed, you will be redirected to the cluster list. After the status of the cluster becomes **Running**, it can be used normally.

## Subsequent operations
After creating the TDSQL-C for MySQL cluster, you can connect to it through its private or public network address or DMC. For more information, see [Connecting to Cluster](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1098/51980).
