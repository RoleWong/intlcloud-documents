The TDSQL-C for MySQL team made an emergency fix for certain monitoring metrics on November 25, 2022. After the fix, the historical data of such metrics in the past month was cleared. Be sure to check the metric changes and alarm thresholds.

## Fix time
Friday, November 25, 2022.

## Fixed metrics
The incorrect data issue of monitoring metrics **QPS (queries executed per second)** and **TPS (transactions executed per second)** caused by abnormal reporting and aggregation was fixed. After the fix, data is aggregated based on the maximum instantaneous value (MAX).

## Impact of change
To avoid ambiguity, the incorrect historical data of the QPS and TPS metrics in the past month was cleared. Be sure to check the metric changes and alarm thresholds.
