TDSQL-C for MySQL provides the cross-AZ data disaster recovery feature to help you deliver continued services at low costs while improving data reliability or meeting compliance requirements.

## Intra-region disaster recovery
TDSQL-C for MySQL supports multi-AZ deployment, where physical servers are deployed in different AZs in the same region. When an AZ fails, the business traffic will be switched to another AZ swiftly, which is imperceptible to the business and requires no changes at the application layer to achieve intra-region disaster recovery.

For more information on how to use this feature, see [Setting Multi-AZ Deployment](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1098/44326).
