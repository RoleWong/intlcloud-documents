 - **Private Network Address**: You can customize the private network address within the available IP range.
 - **Custom Port**: You can customize the port in the range of 1024–65535.
 - **Valid Hours of Old IPs**: The default value is 24 hours, meaning that you can still access the instance at the old IP within 24 hours. You can customize the value between 0 and 168 hours. If you set the value to 0, the old IP will be repossessed immediately, and then you cannot access the instance at it.
