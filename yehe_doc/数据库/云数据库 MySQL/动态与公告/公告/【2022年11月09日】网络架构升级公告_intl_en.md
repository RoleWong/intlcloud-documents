In order to provide better service, higher performance, and lower network latency, the TencentDB for MySQL team has fully upgraded the private network access linkage.
- **Starting from November 9, 2022, the new network architecture has been applied to newly purchased instances to deliver lower latency and higher performance.
- **On December 31, 2022, all existing database instances will be switched to the new network architecture**. A momentary disconnection from the database may occur during the switch. Make sure that your business has a reconnection mechanism.

>- The new architecture will deliver higher performance and network stability and lower network latency. For more information, see [Network Architecture Performance Comparison](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/236/51547).
>- A momentary disconnection from the database may occur during the architecture upgrade. Make sure that your business has a reconnection mechanism.
>- Single-node instances of cloud disk edition are already in the optimal network architecture, so their details page does not indicate whether the network architecture is new. This upgrade will not involve such instances.
>- The new network architecture cannot be used in the classic network, so the new architecture flag will not be displayed for it. To use it, switch to VPC as instructed in [Network Switch](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31915).


## Change time
- Starting from Wednesday, November 9, 2022, the new network architecture is applied to newly purchased instances.
- By Saturday, December 31, 2022, the network architecture of all existing instances will be switched to the new version.

## New network architecture flag
You can view the network architecture upgrade progress of the current instance through the flag after **Basic Info** > **Private Network Address** on the instance details page in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb).
<dx-fold-block title="Not upgraded">
![](https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/HEBZ500_3.png)
If the flag is **Not upgraded**, the current instance has not been scheduled for the network architecture upgrade. We recommend you wait patiently.
</dx-fold-block>
<dx-fold-block title="To be upgraded">
If the flag is **To be upgraded**, the current instance will undergo the network architecture upgrade during the maintenance time. You can adjust the maintenance time to change the upgrade time. If the instance has other tasks to be performed during the maintenance time, the upgrade will be postponed to the next maintenance time. We will send you an upgrade notification in the Message Center about one week before the upgrade.
</dx-fold-block>
<dx-fold-block title="New architecture">
If the flag is **New architecture**, the current instance has already been upgraded to the new architecture.
