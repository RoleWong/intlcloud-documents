This document describes how to clone a TencentDB for MySQL instance and quickly restore data to the newly purchased clone in the console.

## Overview
You can restore a TencentDB for MySQL instance to any point in time within the log backup retention period or from a specific physical backup set by cloning. The clone is a new instance created from the backup data according to the restoration point in time you have specified. After the clone has been verified, you can migrate its data back to the original instance with [DTS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/13709) or you can start using the clone.

#### Clone mode
- Clone an instance and restore the clone to any point in time within the log backup retention period you set.
- Clone an instance and restore the clone from a specific physical backup set within the data backup retention period you set.

#### Billing of the clone
- The clone adopts the pay-as-you-go billing mode. For more information about this billing mode and fee calculation, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/18335).
- The clone will not be billed until the clone process is completed.  

## Prerequisites
- Supported instance architectures: TencentDB for MySQL single-node, two-node, and three-node architectures.
- The original instance must be in **Running** status.
- If the clone mode is set to **By backup set**, the original instance must have created at least one physical backup. You can log in to the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) and view the backup status on the **Backup List** tab.
- Your account balance must be positive.

## Notes
- The specification of the new instance must be greater than or equal to that of the original instance.
- The hard disk space of the clone instance must be larger than the amount of the data to be cloned from, or else the clone task may fail.
- The availability zone, database version, replication mode, and default database parameters of the clone must be the same as those of the original instance.
- The clone will not be displayed in the instance list in the console until the clone process is completed.

## FAQs
#### Will the access to the original instance be affected during the clone process?
The original backup set and binlogs uploaded to COS are used for cloning, which will not affect the access to the source instance.
