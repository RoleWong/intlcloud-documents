## Overview
If you forgot your database account password or need to modify it while using TDSQL for MySQL, you can reset it in the console.

>? We recommended that you regularly reset the password at least once every three months for the sake of data security.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TDSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld/instance-tdmysql). In the instance list, click an instance ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the instance management page.
2. On the instance management page, select **Account Management** tab, find the account for which to reset the password, and select **More** > **Reset Password**.

3. In the pop-up window, enter the **New Password** and **Confirm Password** and click **OK**.
>? To avoid the risks caused by creating, modifying, and deleting account information, we recommend that you configure [access management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1042/33343), and reset the password with caution.
