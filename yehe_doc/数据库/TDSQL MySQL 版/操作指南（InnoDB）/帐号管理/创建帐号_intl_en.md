## Overview
This document describes how to create a TencentDB for MySQL account in the console to manage and connect to the database instance.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TDSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld/instance-tdmysql). In the instance list, click an instance ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the instance management page.
2. On the instance management page, select **Account Management** and click **Create Account**.

3. In the pop-up dialog box, enter the account name, host, and password. After confirming that everything is correct, click **Next**.
 - Account ID: It must contain 1-32 letters, digits, or symbols, and start with a letter.
 - Host: It can be an IP and contain `%`.
 - Password: It must contain 8-32 lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols (`()~!@#$%^&*-+=_|{}[]:<>,.?/`), and cannot start with a slash (/).
 - Maximum connections: If left empty or `0` is passed in, the "max_connections" parameter will take effect.

4. To create an RO account, you need to [configure read/write separation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1042/33351) for it. Confirm the information you enter, click **OK**.
 -If **Source Server** is selected, read from the source server when the delay of replica server times out.
 If **Report Errors** is selected, an error will be reported when all replica servers are delayed.
 - If **Read Only from Replica Server** is selected, ignore the replica delay and always read from replica server (generally used to fetch binlog for sync).
 - If your instance architecture is 1-source-1-replica, select **Read Only from Replica Server** carefully to prevent high-load tasks like large transactions from affecting backup tasks and replica server availability.
