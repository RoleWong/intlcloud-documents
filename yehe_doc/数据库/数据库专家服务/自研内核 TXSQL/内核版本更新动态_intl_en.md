<li>Supported RETURNING in a DELETE, INSERT, or REPLACE statement to retrieve the data rows modified by the statement. For DELETE, the returned data rows are pre-images, while for INSERT and UPDATE, they are post-images.</li>
<li>Supported column compression: Row compression and data page compression are already supported, but if small fields in a table are read and written frequently while big fields are not, both of the compression methods waste a lot of computing resources. In contrast, column compression can compress big fields that are infrequently accessed and reduce the space for storing whole rows of fields, so as to improve read and write access efficiency.</li>

<li>Revoked the restriction on the value of `gtid_purged` being empty.</li>
<li>Optimized the backup lock. `LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`, `LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP`, and `UNLOCK BINLOG` are supported. `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` is used to take a backup of the database, but it blocks the whole database from providing service.

<li>Supported querying the "user thread memory usage" by executing the `show full processlist` statement.</li>
<li>Supported quick column adding for tables as described in <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/35988" target="_blank">Overview</a>. This feature does not replicate the data or use disk capacity/IO, and can implement changes in real time during peak hours.</li>
<li>Supported persistent auto-increment values.</li>
</ul>

<li>Bug fixes</li><ul>
<li>Fixed the issue where replication would be interrupted if the column name in a `GRANT` statement contained reserved words.</li>

<li>Fixed the issue where the query result had an exception due to data inconsistency when using virtual column index and primary key.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue where data was missing due to InnoDB primary key range queries.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue where the system crashed when a DDL statement was executed for a table with spatial indexes.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue where source-replica disconnection occurred when the binlog size was too large and the file length in the heartbeat information exceeded the limit.</li>
