## Overview

You can use the COS console to set or modify bucket access permissions of the following two types.

- **Public permissions**: Include private read/write, public read/private write and public read/write. For more information, see **Types of Permission** under [Bucket Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312).

- **User ACLs**: The root account has all bucket permissions (full control) by default. You can add sub-accounts and grant them permissions including read/write, read/write ACL, and even **full control**.

>?
>- If the bucket permission is private read/write or a specified account is granted the permission, an object request needs to carry a signature for identity verification. For more information on signature, see [Request Signature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7778).
>- If the bucket permission is public read/private write or public read/write, an object request doesn't need to carry a signature, and anonymous users can directly access the object at the URL. However, your data may be leaked. Therefore, proceed with caution.
