## Overview

You can leverage the alarm policy feature of Cloud Monitor to set threshold-reaching alarms for COS monitoring metrics. An alarm policy must include the policy name, policy type, trigger condition, alarm object, and alarm notification template. You can create an alarm policy for COS as instructed below.

>?Tencent Cloudâ€™s Cloud Monitor enables users to monitor cloud resources in real time and provides alarm services. Users can set alarm policies for COS monitoring metrics to query the alarm history and receive alarm notifications. For more information, please see [Creating Alarm Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/38916).

				<br><li>Alarm frequency: You can set a repeated notification policy for each alarm rule. In this way, an alarm notification will be sent repeatedly at a specified frequency when an alarm is triggered.<br>Frequency options: do not repeat, once every 5 minutes, once every 10 minutes, at an exponentially increasing interval, and other frequency options.<br><ul><li type="square">An exponentially increasing interval means that a notification is sent when an alarm is triggered the 1st time, 2nd time, 4th time, 8th time, and so on. In other words, the alarm notification will be sent less and less frequently as time goes on to reduce the disturbance caused by repeated notifications.</li>
      <li>Default logic for repeated alarm notifications: The alarm notification will be sent to you at the configured frequency within 24 hours after the alarm is triggered. After 24 hours, the alarm notification will be sent once a day by default.</li></ul></li>
