The data backup point of a cloud disk is provided by Tencent Cloud to back up data automatically. It is a complete copy of cloud disk data at the backup time and can be used to restore historical data.
Unlike a [snapshot](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31638), the data backup point follows the lifecycle of the cloud disk. When the cloud disk is deleted, the data backup point will be deleted automatically and can no longer be used to restore data.

## Features of the Data Backup Point
- **Backing up historical data**
After the data backup point quota is configured, Tencent Cloud will automatically retain a historical data backup of the cloud disk at any time point on the last calendar day. If data becomes abnormal due to viruses, intrusions, or maloperations, the backup can be used to restore data to a time point before the exception.
- **Long-term backups**
The data backup point at any time point can be converted into a snapshot to retain the data backup for a longer time independent of the cloud disk's lifecycle.


## Data Backup Point Quota[](id:quota)

| Item | Description|
|--|--|
| Data backup point | Data backup created at a time point, which can be used to restore data. |
| Data backup point quota | Number of data backup points that can be retained for a cloud disk. It is billed and can be adjusted/returned. |


- You can configure the data backup point quota for newly purchased or existing cloud disks.
- Currently, only **one** data backup point is supported; that is, only one historical data backup can be retained for a cloud disk. After the data backup point quota is configured for a cloud disk, Tencent Cloud will **automatically** retain a historical data backup of the cloud disk at any time point on the **last calendar day**.
For example, if you purchase a cloud disk on May 2 and configure the data backup point quota to `1`, then:
 - On May 3, a historical data backup at any time point on May 2 will be retained for the cloud disk.
 - On May 4, a historical data backup at any time point on May 3 will be retained for the cloud disk, and the data backup on May 2 will be deleted automatically.
 - The process goes on until the cloud disk reaches the end of its lifecycle.


## Billing Details
#### Pricing
The billing of the data backup point quota is only related to the size of the cloud disk. The billing mode of the quota is the same as that of the cloud disk. For billing details, see [Price Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/2413).
