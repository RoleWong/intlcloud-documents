## 1. Information We Collect and How We Use It

#### 1.1 Personal information required to implement the features of the SDK Product
The implementation of the features of the SDK Product does not require collecting any personal information of end users.

#### 1.2 Permissions required to implement the features of the SDK Product
To implement the features of the SDK Product, we will request the required permissions through the application.

| OS | Permission | Purpose     | Required             |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| iOS      | Network permission | To allow the network access | Applied for by the application and not involved in the SDK |

Note that the permission display and disablement methods may vary by device and system and are subject to the used device and as further described in the operating system developers' instructions. By disabling a permission, end users deny the permission. In this case, we and developers will no longer collect and use the personal information corresponding to the permission and thus will not be able to provide the features that can be provided only if end users enable the permission.

#### 1.3 Exceptions to requiring user consent under laws and regulations 
1. As necessary for the conclusion or performance of the contract with end users.
2. As necessary to fulfill our legal obligations.
3. As necessary to cope with public health emergencies or protect the health or property safety of end users in an emergency.
4. The reasonable processing of end users' personal information for news coverage or public opinion supervision in line with the public interest. 
5. The reasonable processing of end users' personal information made public by themselves or otherwise legally made public in accordance with this Policy. 
6. Other circumstances stipulated by laws and regulations.

**Note: Any information collected by us that cannot identify end users alone or in combination with other information is not personal information within the meaning of the law.**


## 2. How End Users Manage Their Own Information
We attach great importance to end users' right to manage their personal information and endeavor to help them do so, including querying, copying, and deleting their personal information, canceling their account, and configuring the privacy feature, to safeguard their rights. If you are a developer, you must provide methods for end users to query, copy, modify, and delete their personal information, withdraw their consent, and cancel their account.

End users have the right to withdraw their consent to the processing of their personal information based on such consent. We offer developers the capabilities to disable the SDK Product as instructed in [Getting Started](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/45574) for Android or Getting Started for iOS. As we cannot interact directly with end users through UIs, end users can directly contact developers and request them to stop using the SDK Product, or contact us through the channels as provided in Article 7 of this Policy. If you are an end user, you understand that specific business features or services can be implemented only if you provide the information required by such features or services. If you withdraw your consent, we will be unable to continue providing the corresponding features or services, nor will we further process your relevant personal information. Your decision to withdraw your consent does not affect our processing of your personal information previously collected based on such consent.


## 3. Information Storage

#### 3.1 Information storage location
We will store personal information collected and generated in the territory of China in the territory of China in accordance with laws and regulations.

- To comply with applicable laws and regulations.
- To comply with court decisions, judgments, or other legal proceedings.
- To comply with the law enforcement requirements of applicable government authorities.


## 4. Information Security
We implement appropriate safeguards to protect end users' personal information from loss, improper use, or unauthorized access or disclosure.
We protect end users' personal information in strict accordance with laws and regulations.
We use various safeguards within a reasonable level of security to protect the security of information.
For example, we use encryption, anonymization, and other means to protect end users' personal information.
We have a rigorous management policy, process, and organization in place to guarantee the information security.
For example, we strictly limit the access to information to specific people, request them to comply with their confidentiality obligations, and review their compliance.
In the event of a security incident such as personal information leakage, we will launch the contingency plan to prevent the expansion of the incident and notify developers through such means as push notification and notice.


## 5. Minor Protection
The SDK Product is oriented to adults.

If you are a developer, and end users are minors under the age of 14 ("minors"), you must inform the minors' parents or legal guardians of this Policy and may not process the minors' personal information unless you have obtained the consent of their parents or legal guardians. If we find that you have provided the personal information of minors to us without the consent of their guardians, we will take action to delete such personal information as soon as possible.

If you are the guardian of a minor and have any questions or claims regarding the protection of the minor's personal information, you can contact developers or contact us through the channels as provided in Article 7 of this Policy.

## 6. Changes
We may revise this Policy from time to time.

If any revisions to this Policy will lead to the substantial derogation of end users' rights under this Policy, we will announce such revisions through website notices or other means before such revisions take effect. If you are a developer, and the updated Policy specifies changes in the processing of end users' personal information, you must update your privacy policy in due course, notify end users in the form of a pop-up window, and obtain their consent. **If end users do not agree to this Policy, you must stop integrating the SDK Product.**
