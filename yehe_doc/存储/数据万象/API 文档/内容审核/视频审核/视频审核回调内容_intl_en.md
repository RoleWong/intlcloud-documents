## Overview

If you have configured a moderation callback address, after video moderation is completed, the backend will call back the moderation result in JSON format to the callback address. You can perform subsequent file processing operations based on the callback content.

The callback content is divided into simple callback (Simple) and detailed callback (Detail).

## Callback Content Description

### Simple callback (Simple)

The callback notification adopts the `POST` method of HTTP, with the `X-Ci-Content-Version: Simple` header.

The response body returns **application/json** data. The following contains all the nodes:
