## Overview

If you have configured a moderation callback address, after audio moderation is completed, the backend will call back the moderation result in JSON format to the callback address. You can perform subsequent file processing operations based on the callback content.

The callback content is divided into simple callback (Simple) and detailed callback (Detail).

For example, `Porn 99` means that the content is very likely to be pornographic.  | Integer | Yes       |
| label | Result tag of this moderation job. If a sensitive keyword is hit, the keyword will be returned in this field. | String | Yes |

### Detail callback (Detail)

The callback notification adopts the `POST` method of HTTP, with the `X-Ci-Content-Version: Detail` header.

The response body returns **application/json** data. The following contains all the nodes:
