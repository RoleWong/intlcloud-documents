## Scenarios
The user pool is the first-level directory of Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). All the data of users, custom attributes, applications, and authentication sources are isolated by the user pool. Before using CIAM for the first time, you need to create a user pool. The platform allows you to configure multiple user pools.

## Steps
1. Log in to the [CIAM console](https://console.tencentcloud.com/ciam) and select **Overview** in the left navigation pane.
2. If you are logging in to CIAM for the first time and no user pool is created, you can click **Create Now** to experience the quick create feature. The feature automatically creates demo data, including the data of applications and authentication sources.
3. On the **Overview** page, click **Create user pool** in the upper right corner.
