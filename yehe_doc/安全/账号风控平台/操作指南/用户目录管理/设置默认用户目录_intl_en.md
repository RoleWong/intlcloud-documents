## Scenarios
Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) supports multiple user pools. If an administrator is in charge of managing a certain user pool, the administrator can set it as the default user pool. After the default user pool is set, the user pool is displayed by default each time the administrator logs in.

## Steps
1. Log in to the [CIAM console](https://console.tencentcloud.com/ciam) and select **Overview** in the left navigation pane.
2. On the **Overview** page, Click **Manage user pool** in the upper right corner to go to the **User pool management details** page.
