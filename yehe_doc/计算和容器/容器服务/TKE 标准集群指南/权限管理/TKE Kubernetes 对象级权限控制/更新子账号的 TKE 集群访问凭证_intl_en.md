## Access Credentials
Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE) implements the following features based on x509 certificates:
- Each sub-account has a unique client certificate used for accessing Kubernetes API servers.
- Under the new authorization method adopted by TKE, when different sub-accounts obtain access credentials for a cluster (i.e., for accessing the basic information page of the cluster or calling the DescribeClusterKubeconfig API), they will obtain a unique x509 client certificate, which is issued by the self-signed CA of each cluster.
- When a sub-account accesses Kubernetes resources on the console, the backend uses the sub-accountâ€™s client certificate to access the Kubernetes API server by default.
- A sub-account can update its unique client certificate to prevent credential disclosure.
- A root account or an account that has `tke:admin` permission for a cluster can view and update the certificates of other sub-accounts.

## Directions
1. Log in to the TKE console and click **[Cluster](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** on the left sidebar.
