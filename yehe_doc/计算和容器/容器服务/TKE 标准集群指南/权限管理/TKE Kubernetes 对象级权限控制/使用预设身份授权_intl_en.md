## Description of Preset Roles
The Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE) console provides fine-grained permission control for Kubernetes resources based on Kubernetesâ€™ native Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization policies. It also provides the preset roles `Role` and `ClusterRole`, which are described below: 

### Role
The TKE console provides an access management page for which the **root account** and **cluster creator** by default have administrator permissions and can manage sub-accounts that have the DescribeCluster Action permission for a given cluster. See the following figure for more information.

### ClusterRole
- **For all namespaces**:
 - **Administrators (tke:admin)**: have read/write permission for the resources in all namespaces, read/write permission for cluster nodes, storage volumes, namespaces, and quotas, and read/write permission for sub-account configurations.
 - **OPS personnel (tke:ops)**: have read/write permission for the resources visible on the console in all namespaces and read/write permission for cluster nodes, storage volumes, namespaces, and quotas.
 - **Developers (tke:dev)**: have read/write permission for the resources visible on the console in all namespaces.
 - **Restricted personnel (tke:ro)**: have read-only permission for the resources visible on the console in all namespaces.
 - **Custom:** user-defined ClusterRole.
- **For a specified namespace**:
    - **Developers (tke:ns:dev)**: have read/write permission for the resources visible on the console in a specified namespace.
    - **Read-only users (tke:ns:ro)**: have read-only permission for the resources visible on the console in a specified namespace.
- All the preset ClusterRole policies contain the fixed label: `cloud.tencent.com/tke-rbac-generated: "true"`.
- All the preset ClusterRoleBinding policies contain the fixed annotation: `cloud.tencent.com/tke-account-nickname: yournickname` and the label: `cloud.tencent.com/tke-account: "yourUIN"`.

## Directions
### Obtaining credentials
TKE will create independent credentials for each sub-account by default. You only need to access the cluster details page or call the Tencent Cloud API `DescribeClusterKubeconfig` to obtain the credential file `Kubeconfig` of the current account. The procedure for obtaining the file on the console is as follows:
1. Log in to the TKE console and click **[Cluster](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** on the left sidebar.
2. On the **Cluster Management** page, click the ID of the target cluster.
3. On the cluster details page, select **Basic Information** on the left sidebar. Then, you can view and download the Kubeconfig file in the **Cluster APIServer information** section, as shown in the following figure.

### Managing credentials
Cluster administrators can access the credential management page to view and update the cluster credentials of all accounts. For more information, see Updating the TKE cluster access credentials of sub-accounts.


### Authorization
> ? Please contact cluster administrators (root accounts, cluster creators, or users with the admin role) for authorization.
>
1. On the **Cluster Management** page, click the ID of the target cluster. 
2. On the cluster details page, select **Authorization Management** -> **ClusterRoleBinding** on the left sidebar.
3. On the **ClusterRoleBinding** page, click **RBAC Policy Generator**, as shown in the following figure.

4. When you select a sub-account on the **Administration Permissions** page, select the target sub-account and click **Next**.
5. When you set the cluster RBAC, set the permissions as follows:
  - **Namespace List**: specify the namespaces for which the permissions apply.
  - **Permissions**: please reference the descriptions provided on the page and set permissions as needed.
  > ? You can also click **Add Permission** to set custom permissions.

### Authentication
Log in to your sub-account and verify that the sub-account has the permissions in question. If so, this indicates that the authorization was successful.
