## Overview

[Tencent Cloud TKE-KMS Plugin](https://github.com/Tencent/tke-kms-plugin) integrates the rich key management features of Key Management Service (KMS) to provide powerful encryption/decryption capabilities for Secret in Kubernetes cluster. This document describes how to encrypt data for Kubernetes cluster via KMS.  

## Concepts

#### Key Management Service (KMS)
[Key Management Service (KMS)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1030/31961) is a security management solution that leverages a third-party certified hardware security module (HSM) to generate and protect keys so you can easily create and manage keys, helping you to meet your key management and compliance needs in multi-application and multi-business scenarios.  

## Prerequisites
You have created a TKE **self-deployed cluster** that meets the following conditions:
- Kubernetes v1.10.0 or later.  
- Etcd v3.0 or later.  
>?If you want to check the version, you can go to [Cluster Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster) page and select the cluster ID to go to the **Basic Information** page to view.  


## Directions

### Creating a KMS key and obtaining the ID[](id:createKMS)

1. Log in to the [KMS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/kms2), and go to **Customer Managed CMK** page.  
2. At the top of the **Customer Managed CMK** page, select the region for which you want to create a key, and click **Create**.  
3. On the pop-up window, configure the parameters according to the following information, as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/2f0db7dfc9ca005e5ed8fb16aea5ad29.png)
The key parameters are as follows. Retain the default settings for other parameters.
 - **Key Name**: this is required and must be unique within the region. It can contain letters, numbers, `_`, `-`, and cannot begin with `KMS-`. In this document, we take `tke-kms` as an example.  
 - **Description**: this is optional and used to specify the type of data to be protected, or the application to be used in conjunction with the CMK.  
 - **Key Usage**: select **Symmetric encryption and decryption**.  
 - **Key Material Source**: select **KMS** or **External** based on the actual needs. In this document, we take **KMS** as an example.  
4. Click **OK** to go back to **Customer Managed CMK** page to view the created keys.  
5. Click the key ID to go to **Key Information** page, you can view the complete ID of the key on this page. See the figure below:

### Creating and obtaining access key[](id:createCAM)
Before using TKE for the first time, go to the [TencentCloud API Key](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) page to apply for `SecretId` and `SecretKey`. If you already have them, skip this procedure.

1. Log in to the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/overview) and select **Access Key** > **Manage API Key** in the left sidebar to go to the **Manage API Key** page.  
2. On the **Manage API Key** page, click **Create Key** to create a pair of `SecretId`/`SecretKey`.
3. You can check the keyâ€™s information including `SecretId` and `SecretKey` on **Manage API Key** page when the creation is completed. See the figure below:

### Creating a DaemonSet and deploying tke-kms-plugin

1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2) and click **Cluster** in the left sidebar.  
2. On the **Cluster Management** page, click the ID of the cluster that meet the conditions to go to the cluster details page.  
3. Select **Create Via YAML** at the top right corner on any interface of the cluster to go to **Create Via YAML** page. Enter the parameters for `tke-kms-plugin.yaml`, as shown below:
>? Enter values for the following parameters based on the actual needs:
> - `{{REGION}}`: the region where KMS key resides. You can check [Region List](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1030/32175) for the valid values.  
> - `{{KEY_ID}}`: enter the KMS key ID obtained in the step of [creating a KMS key and obtaining the ID](#createKMS).  
> - `{{SECRET_ID}}` and `{{SECRET_KEY}}`: enter the SecretID and SecretKey created in the step of [creating and obtaining access key](#createCAM).  
> - `images: ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/tke-plugin/tke-kms-plugin:1.0.0`: tke-kms-plugin image address. If you want to use the self-created tke-kms-plugin image, you can replace it.

              mountPath: /var/run/tke-kms-plugin
              readOnly: false
```
4. Click **Done** and wait for the DaemonSet to be created.  

### Configuring kube-apiserver
1. Log in to each Master node of the cluster by referring to [Logging in to Linux Instance Using Standard Login Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436).  
>?Master node security group defaults to close port 22. You need to open port 22 on the security group interface before logging in to the node. For more information, see [Adding a Security Group Rule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34272).  

2. Run the following command to create and open the YAML file.  
```
vim /etc/kubernetes/encryption-provider-config.yaml
```
3. Press **i** to switch to the edit mode and edit the YAML file. Enter the followings according to the K8s version that you actually use:
 -  K8S v1.13+:
```
   apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
   kind: EncryptionConfiguration
   resources:
     - resources:
         - secrets
       providers:
         - kms:
             name: tke-kms-plugin
             timeout: 3s
             cachesize: 1000
             endpoint: unix:///var/run/tke-kms-plugin/server.sock
         - identity: {}
```
 - K8S v1.10 - v1.12:
```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: EncryptionConfig
   resources:
     - resources:
         - secrets
       providers:
         - kms:
             name: tke-kms-plugin
             timeout: 3s
             cachesize: 1000
             endpoint: unix:///var/run/tke-kms-plugin/server.sock
         - identity: {}
```
4. After editing is completed, press **Esc** and enter **:wq** to save the file and go back.  
5. Run the following command to edit the YAML file.  
```
vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
```
6. Press **i** to switch to the edit mode and add the followings to `args` according to the K8s version you actually use.  
>?Self-deployed cluster of K8s v1.10.5. You need to remove `kube-apiserver.yaml` from the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests` directory and move it back to the directory after you have completed the editing.  
>
 - K8S v1.13+:
```
 --encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/encryption-provider-config.yaml
```
 - K8S v1.10 - v1.12:
```
--experimental-encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/encryption-provider-config.yaml
```
7. Add Volume command to `/var/run/tke-kms-plugin/server.sock`. The location and content for adding is as follows:
> ?`/var/run/tke-kms-plugin/server.sock` is a unix socket that is listened when tke kms server is launched. kube apiserver will access tke kms server by accessing the socket.  
> 
 Add the followings for `volumeMounts:`:
```
   - mountPath: /var/run/tke-kms-plugin
     name: tke-kms-plugin-dir
```
 Add the followings for `volume:`:
```
   - hostPath:
       path: /var/run/tke-kms-plugin
     name: tke-kms-plugin-dir
```
8. When the editing is finished, press **Esc**, enter **:wq** and save the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` file. Wait for kube-apiserver to restart.  

### Verification

1. Log in to the node of the cluster and run the following command to create a Secret.  
```
kubectl create secret generic kms-secret -n default --from-literal=mykey=mydata
```
2. Run the following command to verify if the Secret has been decrypted correctly.  
```
kubectl get secret kms-secret -o=jsonpath='{.data.mykey}' | base64 -d
```
3. If the output value is `mydata`, i.e. it is equal to the value of Secret, it means Secret has been decrypted correctly. See the figure below:
