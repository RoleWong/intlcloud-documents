The online migration procedure is shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/0e290646e08b6af1b509ce324ea6e096.png)

[](id:prerequisites)
## Preparation

- Register on Tencent Cloud International.
- If you want to migrate using a sub-account, ask the root account owner to assign the sub-account with the `QcloudCSMFullAccess` and `QcloudCVMFullAccess` permissions in [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy).
- Create a key and obtain the `SecretId` and `SecretKey` in [API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi).
- [Download](https://go2tencentcloud-1251783334.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/latest/go2tencentcloud.zip) the compressed migration tool package.
- Stop all applications on the source server to prevent them from being affected by the migration.
- Back up your data in the following ways before migrating:
   - Source server: You can use the source server snapshot feature or other methods to back up data.
   - Destination CVM: You can create a snapshot as instructed in [Creating Snapshots](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/5755) or use other methods to back up data.

## Migration Directions


### Checking before the migration

Before migration, you need to check the following configuration based on the actual conditions:
 - If the migration destination is a CVM instance, you need to check the source server and destination CVM.
 - If the migration destination is a CVM image, you need to check only the source server.

  <tr>
	<th>Linux source server</th>
	<td>
	  <ol style="margin: 0;">
		<li>Check and install Virtio. For more information, see  
		<a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/9929">Checking Virtio Drivers in Linux</a>.</li>
		<li>Run

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
- You can use tool commands such as `sudo ./go2tencentcloud_x64 --check` to automatically check the source server.
- By default, the go2tencentcloud migration tool automatically performs checks upon launch. To skip checks and perform forced migration, configure `Client.Extra.IgnoreCheck` to `true` in the client.json file.

#### Viewing migration source in the console
You can log in to the <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/csm/online?rid=1">CVM console</a> and enter the online migration page to view the imported migration source, whose status is **Online** as shown below:
<img src="https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/11b1e6cada0384dae292e89378629ddc.png"/>
If "Import source server successfully" isn't displayed, the migration source failed to be imported, and you can view the log (which is the `logs/log` file in the migration tool directory by default) for troubleshooting. Then, run the migration tool to import the migration source again.

>! After the migration source is imported successfully, don't close the migration tool in the instance until the migration task is completed; otherwise, the migration task can't be completed after the migration source becomes offline.


### Creating and starting a migration task

1. Create a migration task
Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/csm/online?rid=1), go to the online migration page, and click **Create Migration Task** on the right of the desired migration source. In the **Create Migration Task** pop-up window, configure the task as shown below:

<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
- If the migration destination is a CVM, the destination CVM enters migration mode after the migration starts. Do not reinstall the system, shut down, terminate, or reset passwords of the destination CVM until the migration ends and the destination CVM exits the migration mode.
- If the migration destination is a CVM image, a relay instance `do_not_delete_csm_instance` will be created under your account after the migration starts. Don't reinstall, shut down, or terminate the relay instance or reset its password. It will be automatically terminated by the system after the migration ends.
</dx-alert>


### Waiting for migration task to end


After the migration task status becomes **Successful**, the migration is completed successfully as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/7beb11db18bd9913b44941dd05f8a4a4.png)

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
- The time required for data transfer depends on the size of the data on the source server, network bandwidth, etc. Please wait for the migration process to end.
- After the migration task starts, you can click **Pause** on the row of the task to stop it.
- The migration tool supports checkpoint restart. After a task is paused, you can click **Start/Retry** again to resume migration from where you paused.
- A migration task can be paused during data transfer. After you click **Pause** for it in the console, the migration tool will pause the data transfer in progress.
- If the migration process is time-consuming and you need to stop it, you can pause the migration task first and click **Delete** to delete it.
</dx-alert>

### Checking after migration[](id:checkAfter)

- **Failed migration**:
- Check the error information in log files (under the migration tool directory by default), operation guides, or FAQs about [Service Migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32395) for troubleshooting methods. After troubleshooting, click **Start/Retry** under the operation column to restart the migration task.
- **Successful migration**:
 - Migrating to a CVM: Check whether the destination CVM starts up normally, whether data on the CVM is consistent with that on the source server, and whether the network and other system services are normal.
 - Migrating to a CVM image: Click the **CVM image ID** on the row of the migration task to enter the [CVM image page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/image/index) and view the image information. You can use this image to create CVM instances.

If you have any questions or the migration has an exception, see FAQs about [Service Migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32395) or [Contact Us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34837).
