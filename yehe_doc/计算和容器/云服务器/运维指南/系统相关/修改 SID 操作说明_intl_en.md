## Overview

Windows operating system uses a security identifier (SID) to identify computers and users. CVM instances created with the same image will have the same SID and might experience domain log-in issues. If you need to build a Windows domain environment, you will need to modify the SID.
This document takes the CVM with Windows Server 2012 operating system as an example to describe how to modify the SID using sysprep and sidchg tools of the system.

## Must-knows

- Instruction in this document is only applicable to Windows Server 2008 R2/2012/2016.
- To modify the SIDs of multiple CVMs at the same time, you can create a custom image (select "run sysprep to create the image").
- Modify the SID may cause data loss or system damage. We recommend you create a system disk snapshot or image in advance.

## Directions

### Using sysprep to modify the SID



<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
- After using sysprep to modify the SID, you need to manually reset some system parameters, including IP configuration information.
- When you use sysprep to modify the SID, C:\Users\ Administrator will be reset and some data on the system disk will be erased. Please back up data.

1. [Log in to the Linux CVM via VNC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32496).
2. In the operating system interface, right-click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/87d894e564b7e837d9f478298cf2e292.png" style="margin: -3px 0px;"> > **Run**, enter **cmd**, and press **Enter** to open the admin command line.
3. [](id:step_03)In the admin command line, run the following command to save the current network configuration.
```shellsession
ipconfig /all
```
4. In the admin command line, run the following command to open the sysprep tool.
```shellsession
C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\sysprep.exe
```
5. In the “System Preparation Tool 3.14” window that pops up, make the following configurations.
- Set **System Cleanup Action** to **Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)** and check **General**.
   - Set **Shutdown Options** to **Reboot**.
6. Click **OK**, and the system will restart automatically.
7. After the startup is complete, follow the wizard to complete the configuration (select language, reset password, etc.).
8. In the operating system interface, right-click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/87d894e564b7e837d9f478298cf2e292.png" style="margin: -3px 0px;"> > **Run**, enter **cmd**, and press **Enter** to open the admin command line.
9. Run the following command to verify whether the SID has been modified.
```shellsession
whoami /user
```
If a message similar to the following is returned, the SID has been modified.

10. Reset ENI information (such as IP address, gateway address, DNS, etc.) based on the network configuration information saved in [Step 3](# step_03).


### Using sidchg to modify the SID

1. Log in to your CVM.
2. Access and download the sidchg tool through IE browser.
The download address of sidchg tool: `http://www.stratesave.com/html/sidchg.html`
3. Using the admin command line to run the following command and open the sidchg tool.
In this example, the sidchg tool is saved on C: drive and named as “sidchg64-2.0p.exe”.

`/R` means automatic restart after modification, and` /S` means shutdown after modification. For details, please see [SIDCHG Official Instructions](http://www.stratesave.com/html/sidchg.html).
